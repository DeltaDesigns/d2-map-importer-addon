# Destiny 2 Importer Addon for Blender 4.0+
## !!UNINSTALL ANY PREVIOUS VERSIONS (Pre Blender 4.0) BEFORE INSTALLING THIS ONE!!
Simple Blender addon that simplifies importing Destiny 2 rips from Charm

Install like a normal Blender addon. **(install the zip from [Releases](https://github.com/DeltaDesigns/d2-map-importer-addon/releases), not just the py)**

How to use: https://github.com/DeltaDesigns/Charm/wiki/Blender-Importing

# What it CAN do:
- Assemble maps (Statics, Dynamics, lights and terrain)
- Auto assign gear shaders and textures to Player Gear (excluding fx mesh and reticles)
- Compatible with DARE/DCG skeletons and IK Player Skeleton

# What it CAN'T do:
- Materials for anything that isnt player gear. Due to the inconsistency of in-game shaders, they will have to be manually recreated
- Map decals
- File your taxes
- Uhhhhh probably something else I can't think of right now
